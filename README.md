# FirstSimpleGame


Welcome!

This repository is about a cool first game I'm busy developing. It's not ready yet!!

This game is based of the original Wave game by RTG.

Download development build here:
https://github.com/MaxiMiniJaniJos/FirstSimpleGame/releases/tag/0.1

Levels 1 and 2 are only playable levels for now. Levels will be added with each new version.
Please report bugs, feature requests or feedback about levels or anything in the issues tab here on github.
I'll help you ASAP!

Disclaimer:
Do Not copy my code to make your own Squared. You're allowed to learn from my code but please do not use it to create a Squared. Your allowed to base something of my game or of the original Wave game but please do not copy this code like nothing. It's something I work hard for and I don't really like/appreciate someone stealing it / making advantage of my code.
Ofourse you can use the same game loop or anything like it but just don't copy. If you want to learn and make games then don't copy. Look through my code and learn from it. It'll help you even though my code isn't the best.
